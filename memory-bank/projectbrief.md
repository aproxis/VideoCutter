# Project Brief: VideoCutter

## Project Overview
VideoCutter is a comprehensive video processing toolkit designed to automate the creation of professional slideshows from images and videos. It incorporates depth effects, audio processing, and custom overlays to produce engaging content for social media platforms.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Process both images and videos into standardized formats
2. Split videos into configurable segments
3. Apply depth effects to static images
4. Create slideshows with transitions and effects
5. Add audio (soundtrack, voiceover, transitions) to slideshows
6. Add branding and subscription overlays
7. Support both vertical (9:16) and horizontal (16:9) video formats
8. Provide a user-friendly GUI for configuration

### Technical Requirements
1. Maintain a modular architecture with separate scripts for different functions
2. Ensure compatibility with FFmpeg for video processing
3. Implement efficient image processing with PIL/Pillow
4. Integrate with DepthFlow for 3D parallax effects
5. Support configuration presets for quick setup
6. Organize output in date-time folders for easy management
7. Backup original files to prevent data loss

## Project Goals
1. Streamline the video creation workflow for content creators
2. Reduce manual editing time through automation
3. Maintain high quality output with professional effects
4. Provide flexibility through configurable parameters
5. Create a user-friendly interface accessible to non-technical users

## Success Criteria
1. Complete end-to-end processing pipeline from raw media to finished video
2. Intuitive GUI that requires minimal training
3. High-quality output suitable for social media platforms
4. Processing time significantly faster than manual editing
5. Flexibility to handle various input formats and configurations

## Constraints
1. Dependency on external libraries (FFmpeg, DepthFlow)
2. Processing time dependent on hardware capabilities
3. Limited to specific input formats (MP4, JPG)
4. Fixed aspect ratios (16:9 or 9:16)

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Core video processing and image enhancement (Completed)
- Phase 2: Slideshow creation and audio processing (Completed)
- Phase 3: GUI development and configuration management (Completed)
- Phase 4: Documentation and optimization (In Progress)
