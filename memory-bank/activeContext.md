# Active Context: VideoCutter

## Current Work Focus

The current focus for VideoCutter is on documentation and project organization. The system has been developed with core functionality in place, and now we're working to ensure it's well-documented and structured for maintainability and future development.

### Documentation Priorities

1. **README Creation**
   - Comprehensive documentation of features and usage
   - Clear installation instructions
   - Detailed explanation of the workflow
   - Troubleshooting guidance

2. **Memory Bank Development**
   - Creating structured documentation for project context
   - Documenting system architecture and patterns
   - Recording technical decisions and rationale
   - Establishing baseline for future development

3. **Git Repository Setup**
   - Initializing version control
   - Establishing proper .gitignore
   - Setting up initial commit with documentation
   - Preparing for collaborative development

## Recent Changes

### Documentation Improvements

- Created comprehensive README.md with detailed sections on features, installation, usage, and troubleshooting
- Established memory-bank structure with core documentation files
- Documented system architecture and component relationships

### Code Organization

- Reviewed existing scripts for clarity and organization
- Identified key components and their relationships
- Mapped the processing pipeline for documentation

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Complete Memory Bank**
   - Finalize progress.md documentation
   - Create .clinerules file for project-specific patterns
   - Review and refine existing memory bank documents

2. **Git Repository Setup**

   - Create appropriate .gitignore file
   - Make initial commit with documentation and code
   - Add README and memory bank to repository

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Document configuration options in detail
   - Create example configuration presets
   - Ensure configuration validation is robust

### Medium-term Tasks

1. **Code Refactoring**
   - Improve error handling throughout the pipeline
   - Enhance logging for better debugging
   - Standardize coding patterns across scripts
   - Add more inline documentation

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Improve depth effect quality and performance
   - Add more transition options
   - Enhance audio processing capabilities
   - Implement additional watermark options

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Develop unit tests for core components
   - Create integration tests for the pipeline
   - Establish test data sets

### Long-term Vision

1. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Redesign GUI for better usability
   - Add progress indicators and previews
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality
   - Create visual configuration options

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize video processing for speed
   - Implement parallel processing where possible
   - Reduce memory footprint
   - Optimize for different hardware configurations

3. **Feature Expansion**
   - Add direct social media publishing
   - Implement template system for different video styles
   - Add more advanced effects and transitions
   - Create preset library for common use cases

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Strategy

**Decision**: Create comprehensive documentation in both README and memory bank format.

**Considerations**:
- README provides user-facing documentation
- Memory bank provides developer-focused documentation
- Both are necessary for different audiences
- Documentation should be maintained alongside code changes

### Version Control Strategy

**Decision**: Implement Git for version control.

**Considerations**:
- Enables collaborative development
- Provides change history
- Facilitates feature branching
- Supports release management

### Configuration Management

**Decision**: Continue using JSON-based configuration with GUI management.

**Considerations**:
- JSON is human-readable and editable
- GUI provides user-friendly interface
- Presets enable quick setup for common scenarios
- Format is extensible for future options

### Processing Pipeline

**Decision**: Maintain the current script-based pipeline architecture.

**Considerations**:
- Scripts are modular and maintainable
- Command-line interface enables flexibility
- Pipeline can be extended with new components
- Individual steps can be run independently for testing

## Current Challenges

1. **Documentation Completeness**
   - Ensuring all aspects of the system are documented
   - Balancing detail with readability
   - Keeping documentation in sync with code changes

2. **Configuration Complexity**
   - Managing the growing number of configuration options
   - Ensuring sensible defaults for new users
   - Providing clear guidance on configuration impacts

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Handling external dependencies like FFmpeg
   - Managing Python package requirements
   - Ensuring cross-platform compatibility

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Balancing quality with processing speed
   - Managing memory usage during processing
   - Optimizing for different hardware configurations

## Recent Insights

1. **Modular Architecture Benefits**
   - The decision to use separate scripts has proven valuable for maintenance
   - Each component can be developed and tested independently
   - Pipeline structure provides clear processing flow

2. **Configuration Flexibility**
   - JSON-based configuration has been effective for saving presets
   - GUI provides good accessibility for non-technical users
   - Command-line options enable automation possibilities

3. **Processing Pipeline Efficiency**
   - The sequential processing approach works well for the current scale
   - Date-time based organization prevents conflicts and provides versioning
   - Backup strategy has prevented data loss during development
