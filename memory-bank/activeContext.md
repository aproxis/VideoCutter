# Active Context: VideoCutter

## Current Work Focus

The current focus for VideoCutter is on code documentation and project organization. The system has been refactored into a modular package structure with comprehensive documentation and improved organization.

### Documentation Priorities

1. **Code Documentation**
   - Adding comprehensive docstrings to all modules, classes, and functions
   - Including examples and usage patterns in documentation
   - Ensuring consistent documentation style across the codebase
   - Adding README files to explain directory contents and purpose

2. **Memory Bank Development**
   - Updating documentation to reflect the new modular structure
   - Documenting system architecture and patterns
   - Recording technical decisions and rationale
   - Establishing baseline for future development

3. **Git Repository Management**
   - Maintaining version control with meaningful commits
   - Organizing branches for feature development and refactoring
   - Ensuring proper .gitignore configuration
   - Preparing for collaborative development

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Modular Package Structure

**Decision**: Refactor the codebase into a modular package structure.

**Considerations**:
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enables better separation of concerns
- Facilitates unit testing and code reuse
- Provides a clearer mental model of the system

### Comprehensive Documentation

**Decision**: Add comprehensive docstrings and README files throughout the codebase.

**Considerations**:
- Improves code understanding for new developers
- Serves as a reference for existing developers
- Facilitates maintenance and future development
- Provides examples and usage patterns for components

### Configuration Management

**Decision**: Implement a centralized configuration class with presets.

**Considerations**:
- Simplifies configuration management
- Provides a single source of truth for settings
- Enables easy switching between configurations
- Improves user experience with the GUI

## Current Challenges

1. **Documentation Completeness**
   - Ensuring all aspects of the system are documented
   - Balancing detail with readability
   - Keeping documentation in sync with code changes
   - Providing useful examples and usage patterns

2. **Testing Coverage**
   - Developing comprehensive tests for all components
   - Testing edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensuring tests are maintainable and meaningful
   - Balancing test coverage with development time

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks
   - Balancing quality with processing speed
   - Managing memory usage during processing
   - Optimizing for different hardware configurations

## Recent Insights
