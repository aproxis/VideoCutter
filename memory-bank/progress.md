   - ✅ Added dropdowns in GUI for selecting subscribe and title video overlay files from their respective directories.
   - ✅ Added "Enable" checkbox for Effect Overlay in GUI, with state saving/loading and control enabling/disabling.
   - ✅ Implemented GUI control disabling (greying out) for Watermark, Subscribe Overlay, and Title Overlay sections based on their respective "Enable" checkboxes, ensuring all relevant widgets are correctly enabled/disabled.
   - ✅ Ensured all GUI controls for Watermark, Subscribe Overlay, and Title Video Overlay are properly greyed out when their respective "Enable" checkboxes are unchecked.

## Known Issues

1. **Performance**
   - High memory usage during depth processing
   - Long processing times for large batches
   - Occasional slowdowns with complex transitions
   - GPU acceleration not fully optimized

2. **Compatibility**
   - Font path hardcoded for specific system
   - Some paths may need adjustment for different platforms
   - FFmpeg version dependencies not fully documented
   - Template file requirements not strictly enforced

3. **User Experience**
   - No progress indication during processing
   - Limited error feedback in GUI
   - Configuration options can be overwhelming
   - No preview functionality before processing

4. **Technical Debt**
   - Some hardcoded paths and parameters
   - Inconsistent error handling across scripts
   - Limited inline documentation
   - Duplicate code in some processing functions
   - Assumption that the last file in `media_file_paths` is always the outro video, which could lead to issues if the input list convention changes.

5. **Subtitle System**
   - Limited to single subtitle track
   - No subtitle timing adjustment
   - Limited text formatting options
   - No subtitle editor with timeline
   - ASS format complexity requires careful parameter handling

6.  **Script Architecture**:
    *   `cutter.py` currently handles too much orchestration and direct processing, making it complex.
    *   Some other scripts (`sorter.py`, `cleaner.py`, etc.) might have mixed concerns or could be further modularized for clarity and reusability. This is a key driver for the planned refactoring.

## Next Immediate Steps

1.  **Core Script Refactoring - Phase 1 (Analysis & Design)**:
    *   Detailed analysis of `cutter.py`, `sorter.py`, `cleaner.py`, `slideshow.py`, `subscribe.py`, `depth.py`, and `audio.py`.
    *   Propose a new modular architecture and a plan for the main controller.
    *   Document this plan in `activeContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md`.

2.  **Complete Memory Bank Updates**:
    *   ✅ Create `.clinerules` file.
    *   Review and refine existing documentation to reflect the refactoring plan.
    *   Ensure all key decisions regarding the refactoring approach are documented.

2. **Git Repository Setup**
   - Initialize repository
   - Create appropriate .gitignore
   - Make initial commit with documentation and code
   - Set up branch structure

3. **Configuration Improvements**
   - Create example configuration presets
   - Document all configuration options
   - Improve validation and error handling
   - Standardize parameter naming and structure

4. **Subtitle System Enhancements**
   - Add support for multiple subtitle tracks
   - Implement subtitle timing adjustment
   - Add more text formatting options
   - Enhance subtitle preview with timeline
   - Improve error handling for subtitle processing
